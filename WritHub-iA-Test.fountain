FADE IN:

EXT. A PLACE - DAY

WALTER hangs out in a place.

WALTER
I am hanging out in this place.

CARLOCK
Me too!

WALTER
Holy woah! I didn't see you there, Carlock.

CARLOCK
I know, but I saw you.

WALTER
That is incredible.

CARLOCK
Let's hang out in this place. Together.

WALTER
Already happening.

CARLOCK
This is incredible.

WALTER
Woah! Callback!

CARLOCK
I know right! Callback!

They high five so hard that the world explodes and then re-assembles over the timespan of several billion years, ultimately falling right back to this very moment.

Both Dudes hang out. Together. Forever.

Until the world freakin explodes and everyone dies hard.

>FADE OUT.
