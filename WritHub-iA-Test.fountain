FADE IN:

EXT. A PLACE - DAY

BILL hangs out in a place.

BILL
I am hanging out in this place.

CARLOCK
Me too!

BILL
Holy woah! I didn't see you there, Carlock.

CARLOCK
I know, but I saw you.

BILL
That is incredible.

CARLOCK
Let's hang out in this place together.

BILL
Already happening.

CARLOCK
This is incredible.

BILL
Woah! Callback!

CARLOCK
I know right! Callback!

They high five so hard that the world explodes and then re-assembles over the timespan of several billion years, ultimately falling right back to this very moment.

Both Dudes hang out. Together. Forever.

>FADE OUT.
